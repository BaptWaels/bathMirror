# BathMirror

This is a school project at ISEN Lille. I wanted to create my own connected Mirror from scratch like a DIY thing. You can find here all User Interface code. You can find some photos of it
[here](http://bwaels.io) on my portefolio. Do not hesitate to contact me if you want to know more :)
I use a public Firebase to interact with the mirror. If you want to do so, you can use this one to notify everyone who use the same Firebase, should be fun. Or you can also create your own [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)

## Prerequisite
You need to install :

- Npm [here](https://github.com/npm/npm)
- GruntJS [here](http://gruntjs.com/)
- Bower [here](http://bower.io/)

To run correctly my project, you're computer need a constant access to internet. It will make some HTTP Request to get access to RSS Feeds.

## Build & development

- Run `npm install`
- Run `bower install`
- Run `grunt serve`

After it, a browser will be launch and you'll be able to see the user interface.


## How to build the mirror myself ?!
First, you need a computer screen and a Raspberry Pi. You will also need a one way adhesive, you know like in investigations films. Stick the adhesive on the screen. With it you'll be able to recreate a mirror thing.
I have used high contrasts in my interface to be able to see it through the adhesive.
If you don't want to have a big computer next to the mirror, you can use a Raspberry Pi. Don't forget to install Chromium on your RPI, it should be better.
